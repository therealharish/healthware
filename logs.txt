I've successfully fixed the appointment booking date and time issues you mentioned:

ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed:
Past time slots showing: Updated backend to filter out past time slots when booking for "today"
Limited time slots: Expanded time slots from 8:00 AM to 7:30 PM (was only until 4:30 PM)
Static date options: Replaced hardcoded 4-day selection with a full interactive calendar
Date calculation bugs: Fixed the issue where appointments booked for "Tomorrow" 3 days ago still showed as "Tomorrow"
ðŸ†• New Features:
Interactive Calendar:

Full month view with navigation
Highlights today's date
Prevents selection of past dates
Properly calculates relative dates (Today, Tomorrow, or actual date)
Improved Time Selection:

Organized into Morning and Afternoon/Evening sections
More time slots available (7:00 AM - 7:30 PM)
Better responsive design for different screen sizes
Automatic filtering of past times for current day
Backend Enhancements:

Smart time filtering based on current time
Support for proper ISO date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
Extended time slot availability
Better UI/UX:

Clean calendar interface
Better organized time slots
Consistent design across BookAppointment and TestBooking components
ðŸ”„ How Dates Work Now:
Backend: Stores dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) instead of strings like "Tomorrow"
Frontend: Dynamically calculates and displays relative dates based on current date
Time Filtering: Only shows available future time slots, especially for same-day bookings
Calendar: Shows actual calendar with month navigation, preventing confusion about relative dates
The system now properly handles:

âœ… No more "Tomorrow" appointments showing forever
âœ… Time slots filtered based on current time
âœ… Extended hours until 7:30 PM
âœ… Full calendar for better date selection
âœ… Consistent date handling across the application
The application should now provide a much better user experience for booking appointments and tests!
